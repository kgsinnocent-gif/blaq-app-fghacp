[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Build me a Mobile app title BlaqApp\r\n\r\n1. Color Palette and Theme\r\nDefault Theme (Dark Mode):\r\nPrimary Color: The main accent color is a vibrant purple (#7C3AED). This color is used strategically for key elements like buttons, message bubbles you send, notification badges, and highlights for active tabs. It creates a strong, consistent brand identity.\r\nTheme Change Toggle: There is a floating button with a Sun/Moon icon on the main screens. Tapping this button instantly switches the entire app's color scheme between the default dark mode and a clean, bright light mode. This allows you to customize the appearance to your preference or environment.\r\n2. Splash Screen\r\nAppearance: It features a large, stylized letter \"B\" inside a gradient-filled (blue-to-purple) rounded square, set against the app's signature dark gradient background. Below the logo, the app name \"BlaqApp\" is displayed. It lasts for a couple of seconds before transitioning smoothly to the login screen.\r\n3. Login and Registration\r\nThe app has a complete authentication flow.\r\nLogin Screen: This is the default entry point. For demonstration purposes, the email is conveniently pre-filled with a sample user (kagiso@blaq.app) and the password is password. You can simply hit \"Log In\" to enter the app. It features an icon to toggle password visibility.\r\nRegistration Screen: If you're a new user, you can switch to the \"Sign Up\" form. Here, you can create a new account using your email address, a display name, and a password.\r\nDesign: Both forms are clean and centered, with smooth animations and clear error messages (e.g., \"Passwords do not match\") that appear if something goes wrong.\r\n4. Friends List & Adding Friends\r\nThis app uses an email-first approach for connecting people, similar to Discord, rather than using phone numbers like WhatsApp.\r\nFriends Tab: This is the central hub for managing your social connections. It's organized into four distinct sections for clarity:\r\nAdd a friend: A simple form where you enter the email address of the person you want to add. A request is sent to them if the email is registered.\r\nYour friends: A list of all the users who are currently your friends. From here, you can tap a button to immediately open a chat with them.\r\nIncoming requests: Shows a list of pending friend requests you've received from other users. You have clear buttons to Accept or Decline each request.\r\nSent requests: A list of all the requests you've sent that are still waiting for a response.\r\n5. Status Feature\r\nThis feature is inspired by the \"Stories\" function seen in apps like Instagram and WhatsApp.\r\nStatus Tab: This tab shows status updates from you and your friends. Updates are temporary and expire after 24 hours.\r\nCreating a Status: You can tap on \"My Status\" to upload an image from your device and post it as a status update. You can also add a caption.\r\nViewing Statuses: Friends' statuses are separated into two sections:\r\nRecent Updates: Statuses you haven't seen yet. These are highlighted with a purple ring around the user's avatar.\r\nViewed Updates: Statuses you have already watched.\r\nStatus Viewer: Tapping a status opens a full-screen, immersive viewer. If a user has multiple statuses, they play automatically one after another, with progress bars at the top indicating how many there are. You can tap the left or right side of the screen to navigate between them manually.\r\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will create a plan for building the BlaqApp mobile app with React Native and Expo.\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   Implement the splash screen, login, and registration screens with the specified design and functionality, including the pre-filled email and password for demonstration.\n*   Develop the Friends tab with the ability to add friends via email, view existing friends, and manage incoming/sent friend requests.\n*   Create the Status tab, allowing users to create and view status updates (images with captions) that expire after 24 hours.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Base theme: Dark mode with a vibrant purple (#7C3AED) as the primary accent color.\n    *   Implement a theme change toggle (Sun/Moon icon) to switch between dark and light modes.\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use modern, clean fonts suitable for a messaging app.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-20T15:46:07.735728"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the BlaqApp mobile app with all the specified features.
